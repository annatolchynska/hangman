#  ðŸ’€ HANGMAN_GAME ðŸ’€
---
HANGMAN is a guessing Python terminal game, which runs in the mock terminal of Code Institute on Heroku.

Users try to find out the secret word by suggesting letters or the whole word within a certain number of guesses.

### HOW TO PLAY

The word to guess is shown by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word. 
If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the letter appears in the correct position. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the computer adds one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark. The player may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete â€” signifying that all guesses have been used.
