HANGMAN is a guessing Python terminal game, which runs in the mock terminal of Code Institute on Heroku.

Users try to find out the secret word by suggesting letters or the whole word within a certain number of guesses.

## HOW TO PLAY

The word to guess is shown by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word. 
If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the letter appears in the correct position. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the computer adds one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark. The player may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete â€” signifying that all guesses have been used.

### Data model and third party library

For this game I used a list of random words as my model. The game creates a hidden word chosen from the list and the user has to guess it.

[ASCII Art Library For Python](https://pypi.org/project/art/) was used for fonts as a third party library to give the game an oldschool vibes.

### Technology Used
* [Python programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
* [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) 

---
### Testing
* PEP8CI Python Validator:
no errors were returned when passing through PEP8CI - [Website here](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#)
 
 <img src ="./readme_images/pep8validation.png" alt ="img of pep8 validation">

* Tested the code in the Code Institute Heroku terminal and also the terminal inside of Gitpod.
* Checked that symbols, numbers or empty spaces are coming up as invalid guesses when guessing the word.

### Bugs and unfixed bugs
While running the game I had the problem with a messy terminal. Fortunately, I found the solution with a function that clears terminal. 
No other bugs were found.
