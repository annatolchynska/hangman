---
HANGMAN is a guessing Python terminal game, which runs in the mock terminal on Heroku.

Users try to find out the secret word by suggesting letters or the whole word within a certain number of guesses.

### HOW TO PLAY
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word. 
If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the letter appears in the correct position. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the computer adds one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark. The player may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word.Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete â€” signifying that all guesses have been used.
